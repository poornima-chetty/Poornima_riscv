**LOGIC GATES**
 A logic gate is a device that acts as a building block for digital circuits.

 **combinational circuit**
 Combinational circuits are made up of logic gates. The output of each logic gate is determined by its logic function.

**SEQUENTIAL LOGIC**
sequential Logic is sequenced by a clock signal
D-flipflop
Q Output: This is the main output of the flip-flop and represents the state of the D input at the last clock edge. It reflects the data stored in the flip-flop.
Q' (Q-bar) Output: This is the complement of the Q output. If Q is 1, then Q' is 0, and vice versa.
The D flip-flop also has a Reset input that can be used to reset the flip-flop to a specific state.

**Fibonacci Series**
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,....

$val[15:0] = $reset ? 1 : >>1$val + >>2$val
